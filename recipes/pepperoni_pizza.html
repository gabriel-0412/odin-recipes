    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Quick, Easy and Delicious-Homemade pizza crust and tomato sauce has never been easier-and this recipe for pepperoni pizza produces a delicious classic! </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ (12 ounce) can CONTADINA® Tomato Paste </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano, crushed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil, crushed</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1 (6 ounce) package HORMEL® Pepperoni </li>
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, or more to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>For sauce: Combine all sauce ingredients with 1/2 cup water in a medium bowl; set aside for flavors to develop while making crust. Freeze remaining paste.</li>
        <li>Knead for about 4 minutes, on a floured surface, until dough is smooth and elastic. Add more flour, if needed. (If using RapidRise® Yeast, let dough rest, covered, for 10 minutes.)</li>
        <li>Divide dough in half. Pat each half (with floured hands) into a 12-inch greased pizza pan OR roll dough to fit pans.</li>
        <li>For pizzas: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Top crusts with sauce, pepperoni and cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake for 18 to 20 minutes until crusts are browned and cheese is bubbly. For best results, rotate pizza pans between top and bottom oven racks halfway through baking.</li>
    </ol>
